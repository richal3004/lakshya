            <strong>“The path may be lit or it may be dark. Follow the trail and emerge as the undefeated.”</strong>
            <br>The Line follower robot is an autonomous bot that can detect and follow any track. Generally, the path      
                is predefined visible black line on a white surface with a high contrasted color. Therefore, the task of                                                                           
                this robot is to sense the path using sensors and to cover the track in least possible time.
                <br><br><strong>Specifications</strong>
                    <li>The Robot must be strictly autonomous.</li>
                    <li>The width of the line will be less than 5cm.</li>
                    <li> Dimensions of the Robot should not exceed 30cm*30cm*30cm (l*b*h)</li>
                    <li>The participants have to ensure that room lighting, photography, etc. does not affect the      
                        functioning of the sensors.</li>
                    <li> In case of tie, the design of the Robot may be considered. </li>
                    <li> If none of the Robots finishes the course, then the one which covered the longest distance in less time will be considered the winner. </li>
                    <li>A power supply should be of maximum 24V. </li>

          <ol>
             <li>A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized. Immobilized means a robot is not 
                   responsive for a specified period of time</li>
             <li>
                  Points will be given on the basis of aggression, damage, control and strategy.
           <ul>
                     <li><strong>Aggression:</strong>Aggression is judged by the frequency, severity, boldness and 
                         effectiveness of attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If a robot 
                         appears to have accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be considered Aggression.
                     </li>
                     <li><strong>Control:</strong>Control means a robot is able to attack an opponent at its weakest 
                         point, use its Weapons in the most effective way, and minimize the damage caused by the 
                         opponent or its weapons.</li>
                     <li><strong>Damage:</strong>Through deliberate action, a robot either directly or indirectly 
                         reduces the functionality, effectiveness or defensibility of an opponent. </li>
                     <li><strong>Strategy:</strong>The robot exhibits a combat plan that exploits the robots strengths 
                         against the weaknesses of its opponent. Strategy is also defined as a robot exhibiting a 
                         deliberate defense plan that guards its weaknesses against the strengths of the opponent</li>
             </ul>

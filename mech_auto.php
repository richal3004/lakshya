               <p>There can be no 'graduated exercises in drawing' leading up to an artistic creation. That goal can be attained only through the development of mechanical technique and through the freedom of the spirit.<br> Come mechmerize yourselves with the whole bunch of events of our mech-auto section:'Mechmerize'.</p>

         <h6>Abstract:</h6>
         <br>
         <p>An event for you enthusiastic Engineers, to build up your knowledge of making rapid mechanism to solve the task which is given at that moment.<br>So if you’re ready to show your geometry and physics skills then come here and enjoy this engrossing field with the most effectual mechanism from wood and spring.</p>
         <h6>Problem Statement:</h6>
         <p>Participants have to design a “Throwing Arm” using any convenient mechanism and have to demonstrate the accuracy of their Throwing Arm. Prior to that, participants have to design and fabricate very simple mechanism to perform the given task at that moment. Dimension of mechanism and range will be specified on the event spot and continue further.</p>

         <ul>
         	<li>Let your remote-controlled car jump, fly and Run Through difficulties.</li>
         	<li>Design a wireless remote controlled car that has capacity to cover maximum distance in shortest possible time, challenging the hurdles and be one of the best opponents. Think your Car can overcome any obstacle-big or small in the least of time. If so get it on the track and let the game begin. And bear in mind that maximizing RPM does not make you winner but winners are those who have good presence of mind, sharpness and practice.</li>

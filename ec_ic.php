         <h5>ARDUINO HACK AND MAKE</h5>
         <p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               The competition consists of three rounds.
            </li>
            <li>
               First round consists of a pen paper test with questions including from C/C++ logic developing, digital and basic electronics.<br>
               <ol>
                  <li>This round consists of 30 questions to be answered in 30 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Top 10 teams scoring highest marks will proceed to the next round.</li>
                  <li>In case of a dispute, decision of the management is final.</li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
               Second round consists of circuit design. Each team will be given a basic Arduino project, they will have to design circuit diagram using pen and paper(pin diagram will be given) or use their personal laptops if possible.<br>And they also have to make a rough flowchart of the code which they will use to run the circuit.<br>
               <ol>
                  <li>Teams have to design circuits within 60 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Top 4 teams will be selected based on their scores.</li>
                  <li>Scoring will be done on the bases of complexity of the circuit number of components used and logic used in writing code etc.</li>
                  <li>In case of a dispute, decision of the management is final.</li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
               Third round which is the final round, the four selected teams will have to implement the circuit on the Arduino board (which will be given by the management) and create a working model of the project.<br>
               <ol>
                  <li>There is no time limit for this round.</li>
                  <li>The team which finishes first wins the competition.</li>
